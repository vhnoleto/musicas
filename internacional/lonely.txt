Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely
Yo! This one here
Goes out to all my players out there man, ya know
That got that one good girl who's always been there man, like
Took all the bullshit
But then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave
Yeah
I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreaming, for her I was feenin'
So I had to take a little ride
Back tracking over these few years
Tryna figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashing and I'm so
Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own girl)
I'm so lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own girl)
Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you a good girl
And I had no right
I really wanna make things right
'Cause without you in my life girl I'm so
Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own girl)
I'm so lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own baby)
Been all about the world ain't never met a girl
That could take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasing you
'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely
Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own no)
I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own girl)
Lonely
Never thought that I'd be alone (Be alone)
I didn't think you'd be gone this long (Gone so long)
I just want you to call my phone
Stop playing girl and come on home (Come on home)
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out (Work it out baby)
I'd never wish to ever hurt my baby
And it's driving me crazy 'cause I'm so
Lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own no)
I'm so lonely (So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (To call my own girl)
I am so Lonely
So lonely (Lonely)
So lonely (So Lonely)
Mr. Lonely (Lonely)
So lonely (So Lonely)
So lonely (Lonely)
So lonely (So lonley)
So lonely
Mr. Lonely
